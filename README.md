# Breast Cancer Survival Prediction with Machine Learning
# Hacklytics '23 Project - Breast Cancer Prediction (Healthcare)
### Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer that affects women globally. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for successful treatment and improving survival rates. 

In this project, we aim to develop a breast cancer prediction model using Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm, specifically the Support Vector Classification (SVC) variant.

### Understanding the Data

Patient_ID: unique identifier id of a patient

Age: Age of patient (Years)

Gender: Male or Female.

Protein1, Protein2, Protein3, Protein4: biomarkers for the dectection of breast cancer.

Tumour_Stage: I, II, III: describing the extensiveness of brest cancer

Histology: Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma, Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma, Mucinous Carcinoma.

ER status: Positive/Negative:(Estrogen receptor): determines the type of breast cancer to determine treatment.

PR status: Positive/Negative:(Progesterone receptor): determines the type of breast cancer to determine treatment.

HER2 status: Positive/Negative.(human epidermal growth factor receptor2):  promotes the growth of cancer cells . 

Surgery_type: Lumpectomy, Simple Mastectomy, Modified Radical Mastectomy, Other surgery type.

Date of Surgery: the date the surgery was performed (in DD-MMM-YY).

Date of Last_Visit: Date of last visit (in DD-MMM-YY) to the hospital.
Patient_Status: If Alive or Dead
